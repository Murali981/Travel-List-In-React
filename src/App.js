    // get access to the items object and now we want to filter out the item that has the id that we have got as the argument to the
    // "handleDeleteItem(id)" function and whenver the id that we have passed in to the handleDeleteItem(id) function is different from
    // items array id then the item will end up in the new array. So to the array of items that have not been deleted But when this is
    // false , so when the item.id === id then this element will be no longer part of the final array. So this is procedure we follow

  /* HOW WE USE CONTROLLED ELEMENTS WHEN WE USE FORMS WITH REACT ? */
  /* By default the input fields like the input , select where they mantain there own state inside the DOM. So basically inside the HTML 
element itself , Now this makes it hard to read their values and also it leaves the state right inside the DOM which is not ideal for
many reasons . So in React we like to keep all the state in just one central place. So inside the React application and not inside 
the DOM . So inorder to do that we use a technique called CONTROLLED elements and with this technique it is the REACT who controls 
and owns the state of these input fields but no longer the DOM. So since we want to keep this data inside the application it means
that we need some state because the form data changes over time and also we want to mantain our application in sync with it. Inorder to
implement the controlled elements technique we will follow three steps */

  // Step 1: Create a State
  const [description, setDescription] = useState(""); // Now use this state as the value of the input field.
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
  // const [items, setItems] = useState([]); // As we are rendering multiple items onto the UI. So it has to be an array state.

  // Here the above items state has to be rendered in "PackingList" component but we can't pass this items state as props because
  // "PackingList" component is a sibling component to this "Form" component as we already know state can be passed as props only
  // from the parent to child component but it cannot be passed from sibling component to sibling component and also it cannot be passed
  // as a prop from child to parent because props can only be passed down from parent to child but these cannot be passed from child to
  // parent as there will be only one way flow. So the solution to this problem is , Lifting up the state which is lifting the state to the
  // closest parent component to this "Form" component which is the "App" component . So we will lift this "items" array state to the
  // "App" component to solve this problem.
